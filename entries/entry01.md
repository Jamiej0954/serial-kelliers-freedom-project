# Entry 1

When reading or coming across a word that's spell "s-e-r-i-a-l k-i-l-l-e-r-s", my brain immediately clicked. People often or rather I often hold the idea that in order to be consider a serial killers, one have to commit over 30 or more murder. I went online and type in serial killer, it states that "a serial killer is typically a person who murders three or more people, usually in service of abnormal psychological gratification". I am at disbelief at first because of the quanity amount of people doesn't added up to what I expected it to be.

Just the word "serial killers" itself fastinate me. I don't know the specific reason why, but mostly for entertainment purposes or just because I am curious about crime. The idea that we live among the serial killers are indeed scary, and it kind of teaches me to be wary of people who have mental disorder or anything that makes them sketchy. 

Each serial killers are unique, they kill in a different way. I like doing reserach on how they commit their crime and how they got away if they do. I also like how science field such as DNA testing, could change or crack the murder cases. Personally, I am very interested in science and DNA modifying, and I felt that learning about how the police track down the killer using DNA will maybe give me a further insight into the field that I wanted to study. In regard to my current stage, I am still trying to find cases that's solve by science.
